Packaging Pick a unique package name. If you own a URL associated with your project, you can use it as your top level package. For example if you own \u201cexample.com\u201d, you may use com.example as your top level package. Important If you do not own a domain, do not use it for your top level package. You can use your email, a subdomain of where you host a website, or your name/username as long as it can be unique. After the top level package (if you have one), you append a unique name for your mod, such as examplemod . In our case it will end up as com.example.examplemod . The mods.toml file Important The license field in the mods.toml is required. If it is not provided, an error will occur. See your choices at https://choosealicense.com/ This file defines the metadata of your mod. Its information may be viewed by users from the main screen of the game through the \u2018Mods\u2019 button. A single info file can describe several mods. The mods.toml file is formatted as TOML , the example mods.toml file in the MDK provides comments explaining the contents of the file. It should be stored as src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml . A basic mods.toml , describing one mod, may look like this: # The name of the mod loader type to load - for regular FML @Mod mods it should be javafml modLoader=\"javafml\" # A version range to match for said mod loader - for regular FML @Mod it will be the forge version # Forge for 1.19 is version 41 loaderVersion=\"[41,)\" # The license for your mod. This is mandatory and allows for easier comprehension of your redistributive properties. # Review your options at https://choosealicense.com/. All rights reserved is the default copyright stance, and is thus the default here. license=\"All Rights Reserved\" # A URL to refer people to when problems occur with this mod issueTrackerURL=\"github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues\" # If the mods defined in this file should show as separate resource packs showAsResourcePack=false [[mods]] modId=\"examplemod\" version=\"1.0.0.0\" displayName=\"Example Mod\" updateJSONURL=\"minecraftforge.net/versions.json\" displayURL=\"minecraftforge.net\" logoFile=\"logo.png\" credits=\"I'd like to thank my mother and father.\" authors=\"Author\" description=''' Lets you craft dirt into diamonds.

Since the user development environment has no jar manifest to pull from, it will be NONE instead. As such, it is usually recommended to leave the version field alone. Here is a table of attributes that may be given to a mod, where mandatory means there is no default and the absence of the property causes an error. Property Type Default Description modid string mandatory The modid this file is linked to. version string mandatory The version of the mod. It should be just numbers separated by dots, ideally conforming to Forge\u2019s Semantic Versioning structure. displayName string mandatory The user-friendly name of this mod. updateJSONURL string \"\" The URL to a version JSON . displayURL string \"\" A link to the mod\u2019s homepage. logoFile string \"\" The filename of the mod\u2019s logo. It must be placed in the root resource folder, not in a subfolder. credits string \"\" A string that contains any acknowledgements you want to mention. authors string \"\" The authors of this mod. description string mandatory A description of this mod. displayTest string \"MATCH_VERSION\" Controls the display of the mod in the server connection screen. dependencies [list] [] A list of dependencies of this mod. * All version ranges use the Maven Version Range Specification . The Mod File Generally, we will start with a file named after your mod and put into your package. This is the entry point to your mod and will contain some special indicators marking it as such. What is @Mod ? This is an annotation indicating to the Forge Mod Loader that the class is a Mod entry point. The @Mod annotation\u2019s value should match a mod id in the src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml file. Keeping Your Code Clean Using Sub-packages Rather than clutter up a single class and package with everything, it is recommended that you break your mod into subpackages. A common subpackage strategy has packages for common and client code, which is code that can be run on both server/client and only client, respectively. Inside the common package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Block Entities (which can each, in turn, be another subpackage). Things like Screens and Renderers would go inside the client package. Note This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system. By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically. Class Naming Schemes A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and it also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things. For Example: An Item called PowerRing would be in an item package, with a class name of PowerRingItem . A Block called NotDirt would be in a block package, with a class name of NotDirtBlock . Finally, a BlockEntity for a block called SuperChewer would be a block.entity or blockentity package, with a class name of SuperChewerBlockEntity . Appending your class names with what kind of object they are makes it easier to figure out what a class is or guess the class for an object.","title":"Structuring Your Mod"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#structuring-your-mod","text":"Let us look at how to organize your mod into different files and what those files should do.","title":"Structuring Your Mod"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#packaging","text":"Pick a unique package name.

In our case it will end up as com.example.examplemod .","title":"Packaging"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#the-modstoml-file","text":"Important The license field in the mods.toml is required.

A common subpackage strategy has packages for common and client code, which is code that can be run on both server/client and only client, respectively. Inside the common package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Block Entities (which can each, in turn, be another subpackage). Things like Screens and Renderers would go inside the client package. Note This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system. By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically.","title":"Keeping Your Code Clean Using Sub-packages"},{"location":"gettingstarted/structuring/#class-naming-schemes","text":"A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and it also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things. For Example: An Item called PowerRing would be in an item package, with a class name of PowerRingItem . A Block called NotDirt would be in a block package, with a class name of NotDirtBlock . Finally, a BlockEntity for a block called SuperChewer would be a block.entity or blockentity package, with a class name of SuperChewerBlockEntity . Appending your class names with what kind of object they are makes it easier to figure out what a class is or guess the class for an object.","title":"Class Naming Schemes"},{"location":"gettingstarted/versioning/","text":"Versioning In general projects, Semantic Versioning is often used (which has the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ). However, in the case of modding it may be more beneficial to use the format MCVERSION-MAJORMOD.MAJORAPI.MINOR.PATCH to be able to differentiate between world-breaking and API-breaking changes of a mod. Examples Here is a list of examples that can increment the various variables. MCVERSION Always matches the Minecraft version the mod is for. MAJORMOD Removing items, blocks, block entities, etc. Changing or removing previously existing mechanics. Updating to a new Minecraft version. MAJORAPI Changing the order or variables of enums. Changing return types of methods. Removing public methods altogether. MINOR Adding items, blocks, block entities, etc. Adding new mechanics. Deprecating public methods. (This is not a MAJORAPI increment since it doesn\u2019t break an API.) PATCH Bugfixes. When incrementing any variable, all lesser variables should reset to 0 . For instance, if MINOR would increment, PATCH would become 0 . If MAJORMOD would increment, all other variables would become 0 . Work In Progress If you are in the initial development stage of your mod (before any official releases), the MAJORMOD and MAJORAPI should always be 0 . Only MINOR and PATCH should be updated every time you build your mod. Once you build an official release (most of the time with a stable API), you should increment MAJORMOD to version 1.0.0.0 . For any further development stages, refer to the Prereleases and Release candidates section of this document. Multiple Minecraft Versions If the mod upgrades to a new version of Minecraft, and the old version will only receive bug fixes, the PATCH variable should be updated based on the version before the upgrade. If the mod is still in active development in both the old and the new version of Minecraft, it is advised to append the version to both build numbers. For example, if the mod is upgraded to version 3.0.0.0 due to a Minecraft version change, the old mod should also be updated to 3.0.0.0 . The old version will become, for example, version 1.7.10-3.0.0.0 , while the new version will become 1.8-3.0.0.0 . If there are no changes at all when building for a newer Minecraft version, all variables except for the Minecraft version should stay the same. Final Release When dropping support for a Minecraft version, the last build for that version should get the -final suffix. This denotes that the mod will no longer be supported for the denoted MCVERSION and that players should upgrade to a newer version of the mod to continue receiving updates and bug fixes. Pre-releases It is also possible to prerelease work-in-progress features, which means new features are released that are not quite done yet. These can be seen as a sort of \u201cbeta\u201d. These versions should be appended with -betaX , where X is the number of the prerelease. (This guide does not use -pre since, at the time of writing, it is not a valid alias for -beta .) Note that already released versions and versions before the initial release can not go into prerelease; variables (mostly MINOR , but MAJORAPI and MAJORMOD can also prerelease) should be updated accordingly before adding the -beta suffix. Versions before the initial release are simply work-in-progress builds. Release Candidates Release candidates act as prereleases before an actual version change. These versions should be appended with -rcX , where X is the number of the release candidate which should, in theory, only be increased for bugfixes. Already released versions can not receive release candidates; variables (mostly MINOR , but MAJORAPI and MAJORMOD can also prerelease) should be updated accordingly before adding the -rc suffix.
